![Dashboard Screenshot](Sales dashboard.jpg)

## 📖 Project Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard analyzes 4,000+ transactional records from a global retail superstore. The project transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance across different regions, product categories, and shipping modes.

The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and create a tool that identifies **profitability leaks** and **high-value customer segments** to support operational decision-making—skills directly applicable to retail insights and store operations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Business Intelligence:** Microsoft Power BI (Desktop & Service)
* **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Power Query
* **Data Modelling:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* **Data Source:** Microsoft Excel / CSV

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset consists of a raw Excel sales log (Global Superstore) containing fields such as Order Date, Shipping Mode, Customer Segment, Region, Product Category, Sales, Quantity, and Profit.

## 📊 Features

### 1. Business Problem & Goal
A retail chain struggled to identify which regions and product sub-categories were driving actual profit versus just top-line revenue. The goal of this dashboard is to provide a self-service interface for Store Managers and Regional Directors to:
* Track real-time KPIs (Sales, Profit, Quantity).
* Identify underperforming product lines.
* Optimize logistics by analyzing shipping mode distribution.

### 2. Visual Walkthrough
* **Executive Scorecard:** High-level KPI cards for Total Sales ($2.2M+), Total Profit, and Quantity to provide an immediate "health check" of the business.
* **Geographic Analysis:** A map visualization identifying sales penetration across different states and regions.
* **Category Decomposition:** Interactive bar and donut charts that allow users to drill down from broad Categories (e.g., Technology) into specific Sub-Categories (e.g., Copiers).
* **Logistics Breakdown:** Analysis of Shipping Modes (Economy, Priority, etc.) to understand customer fulfillment preferences.

### 3. Business Impact & Insights
* **Margin Optimization:** Identified that while certain categories have high sales volume, specific sub-categories (like Tables) were yielding lower profit margins, suggesting a need for inventory strategy shifts.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Pinpointed the "Central" region as a high-volume area, providing data to support localized marketing and supply chain allocation.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Isolated "Consumer" vs. "Corporate" performance, allowing for tailored promotional strategies based on segment profitability.
